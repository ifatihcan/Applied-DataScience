# Data-Mining
Collection of Data Science and Machine Learning Projects


This repository hosts a variety of data science and machine learning projects. Each project features data preprocessing, model building, and performance evaluation, with descriptions below:

Projects Overview
Comparing Model Performance: Compares logistic regression, k-NN, decision trees, random forests, and Naive Bayes across multiple metrics to assess model performance.

Diabetes Prediction: Uses logistic regression to predict diabetes, including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and model evaluation with a confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve.

Employee Attrition Prediction: Predicts employee attrition with logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. Metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC.

Marketing Campaign Response Prediction: Predicts responses to a marketing campaign using logistic regression, evaluated with confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC AUC.

Wine Quality Prediction: Predicts wine quality based on physicochemical properties using k-NN, evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.

Real Estate Price Prediction: Predicts real estate prices using multiple linear regression. Metrics include R-squared, MAE, RMSE, and max error.

Air Quality Prediction: Analyzes pollutant concentrations to predict air quality using logistic regression, evaluated with a confusion matrix and ROC curve.

Each project folder contains:

notebook.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with the complete analysis.
README.md: Detailed project description, including data sources, methodology, and results.
